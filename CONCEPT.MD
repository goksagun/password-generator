# How to Create, Remember, and Secure a Strong Password

Passwords have become a big part of our lives in the digital age. We use them, so often it is 
easy to overlook the importance of creating a strong one. Almost every  bit of private information 
about us is stored behind a password. If that password were to fail into the wrong hands, it could 
jeopardize our personal and financial livelihood.

## How to Create a Strong Password

### Make it Long

- Use a minimum of at least 1- characters

### Add Variety

- Include numbers, symbols, capital and lower-case letters
- Add emoticons :) :( :S ;) :@ :3 :L 8) :! :D :] :} :O :/ 8( <3

### Make it Unique

- Don't use personal information
- Don't use dictionary words
- Avoid common substitutions "M0use" isn't strong just because the o was replaced with a 0.

## How to Remember a Strong Password

The secret to creating a hard-to-crack password that's unique and easy to remember is to focus on 
making it memorable and making it hard to guess. By learning a few simple skills, you can easily 
create a strong and memorable password with minimal effort. Plus, creating them can actually be 
fun and your payoff in increased safety is huge.

### Use a Bizarre Passphrase with Symbols and Numbers

Creating an odd passphrase of words that typically donâ€™t go together is a good way to create 
the base of a long password. Some sites will even allow spaces. Add symbols and numbers to 
make it even stronger.

_**Example**_: 32 Seagulls deliver bologna sandwiches to Paris

_**Example**_: 32-Seagullsdeliver bologna5andwiches2Paris!

### Use a PHRASE and Incorporate Shortcuts or Acronyms

Use phrases that mean something to you and shorten them by using shortcuts; or use the first 
digit in each word to create an acronym and add numbers and symbols throughout.

_**Shortcut Example**_: 2BorNot2B_ThatisThe? (To be or not to be, that is the question-Shakespeare)

**_Acronym Example_**: I go bowling every Friday night with 8 friends becomes 1gbeFnw8f:)

### Use Random Words to Create Passphrase

This method does not follow the traditional password advice of not using dictionary words. 
Instead, use four or five random words and string them together to create a passphrase that 
involves multiple words. The randomness of the word choice and length of the passphrase are 
what makes it strong. 


The most important thing to remember is that the words need to be random. For example, "cat in 
the hat" would be a terrible combination because it is such a comon phrase and the words make 
sense together. But, something like "correct horse battery staple" doesn't make sense and the 
words aren't in grammatically correct order.

## How to Secure a Strong Password

- **Don't Reuse it**: Having various passwords makes it harder for a cybercriminal to compromise 
your accounts. In the case that someone got a hold of your passwords, you can rest assured 
your other accounts are safe. Using a password manager will help you generate new unique 
passwords for each site you visit.
- **Use Two-Factor Authentication**: Two-factor authentication adds another layer of defense for
your information. This technology enables you to provide multiple pieces of information as 
authentication, in any combination of:
  - Something you know-Your password
  - Something you have-One-Time-Passcode or Generated Key
  - Something you are: Your Fingerprint, Voice, or Iris
